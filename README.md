Exploratory Data Analysis on Dataset - Terrorism 

As a security/defense analyst, we aimed to identify the hot zones of terrorism. It was an interesting experience to implement data analysis techniques in the political realm.

We chose Python for analyzing the dataset. Although the dataset had limited explanations for the abbreviated feature names, we created clear features to extract information about hot zones. We identified the top 10 countries most affected by terror attacks. Using visualization tools such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly Express, we demonstrated the distribution of terrorist group attacks and the change in attack frequency over the years. By analyzing the types of targets, we defined the primary target population. Additionally, we presented the outcomes of the attacks by detailing the number of people killed and wounded. The main regions, cities, and other details of terror attacks were the primary focus of our analysis.
